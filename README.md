# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using supervised machine learning algorithms.
It follows a standard data mining workflow â€” from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset
We use the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset available on Kaggle:

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering & Encoding
4. Model Building & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Results
